Alternatively, you can switch between projects and clusters using the main menu.

- To switch between clusters, open the **Global** view and select **Clusters** from the main menu. Then open a cluster.
- To switch between projects, open a cluster, and then select **Projects/Namespaces** from the main menu. Select the link for the project that you want to open.
