# Installation

This section contains instructions for installing Rancher in development and production environments.

Choose from the following installation options:

- [Single Node Installation]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/single-node-install)

	In this simple install scenario, you install Rancher on a single Linux host.

- [Single Node Installation with External Loadbalancer]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/single-node-install-external-lb)

	In this scenario, you install Rancher on a single Linux host and access it using an external loadbalancer/proxy.

-  [High Availablity Installation]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/ha-server-install/)

 	This install scenario creates a new Kubernetes cluster dedicated to running Rancher Server in a high-availabilty (HA) configuration.

-  [Air Gap Installation]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/air-gap-installation/)

 	We also have instructions for a more specialized use case where you install Rancher Server in an environment without an Internet connection.
