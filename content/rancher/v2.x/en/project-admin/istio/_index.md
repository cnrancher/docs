_Available as of v2.3.0-alpha5_

Using Rancher, you can connect, secure, control, and observe services through integration with [Istio](https://istio.io/), a leading open-source service mesh solution. Istio provides behavioral insights and operational control over the service mesh as a whole, offering a complete solution to satisfy the diverse requirements of microservice applications.

Istio requires each pod in the service mesh to run an Istio compatible sidecar. This section describes how to set up Istio sidecar auto injection in the Rancher UI. For more information on the Istio sidecar, refer to the [Istio docs](https://istio.io/docs/setup/kubernetes/additional-setup/sidecar-injection/).

>**Prerequisites:**
>
>- [Istio]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/cluster-admin/tools/istio/) must be enabled in the cluster.
>- To be a part of an Istio service mesh, pods and services in a Kubernetes cluster must satisfy the [Istio Pods and Services Requirements](https://istio.io/docs/setup/kubernetes/prepare/requirements/).

## Istio Sidecar Auto Injection

If an Istio sidecar is not injected into a pod, Istio will not work for that pod. If you enable Istio sidecar auto injection for a namespace, all pods created in the namespace will have an injected Istio sidecar.

In the create and edit namespace page, you can enable or disable [Istio sidecar auto injection](https://istio.io/blog/2019/data-plane-setup/#automatic-injection). When you enable it, Rancher will add `istio-injection=enabled` label to the namespace automatically.

Injection occurs at pod creation time. If the pod has been created before you enable auto injection, you need to kill the running pod and verify that a new pod is created with the injected sidecar. 

For information on how to inject the Istio sidecar manually, refer to the [Istio docs](https://istio.io/docs/setup/kubernetes/additional-setup/sidecar-injection/).

## View Traffic Graph

Rancher integrates a Kiali graph into the Rancher UI. The Kiali graph provides a powerful way to visualize the topology of your Istio service mesh. It shows you which services communicate with each other.

To see the traffic graph for a particular namespace:

1. From the **Global** view, navigate to the project that you want to view traffic graph for.

1. Select **Istio** in the navigation bar.

1. Select **Traffic Graph** in the navigation bar.

1. Select the namespace. Note: It only shows the namespaces which have the `istio-injection=enabled` label.

## View Traffic Metrics

Istioâ€™s monitoring features provide visibility into the performance of all your services. To see the Success Rate, Request Volume, 4xx Response Count, Project 5xx Response Count and Request Duration metrics:

1. From the **Global** view, navigate to the project that you want to view traffic metrics for.

1. Select **Istio** in the navigation bar.

1. Select **Traffic Metrics** in the navigation bar.


## Other Istio Features

There are many other [Istio Features](https://istio.io/docs/concepts/what-is-istio/#core-features)
that you can now use in your cluster.
