## Running for development/editing

The `rancher/docs:dev` docker image runs a live-updating server.  To run on your workstation, run:

```bash
  ./scripts/dev
```

and then navigate to http://localhost:9001/.  You can customize the port by passing it as an argument:

```bash
  ./scripts/dev 8080
```
